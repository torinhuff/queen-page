    <h1>A bunch of, bunch of, bunch of random facts about Queen</h1>
  <div class="sidebar">
    <h3>Really Random...</h3>
    <p>Not all artists are drop-outs</p>
    <p>Freddie Mercury aka Farrokh Bulsara</p>
    <p>Freddie named the band “Queen”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="columns">
    <p>People often think that rock stars dedicate their whole life to music and hence are not much good in studies. A big blow to such misconception is the Queen Band. Except Freddie Mercury, every other band member has a post graduate degree. So, the Queen is actually pretty smart. It’s ok Freddi, that is not why they made you the lead singer; you are actually good! A degree doesn’t make you smarter, but educated.</p>
    <p>When Freddie Mercury was born, he was named Farrokh Bulsara as he belonged to an Indian family from Gujarat. But later when he was studying in a boarding school, he adopted the name Freddie Mercury. Strangely his name in the passport is Fredrick Mercury. Again Freddie, “what’s in a name.” Did you even read Shakespear ? What’s there in it anyway.. ahemm..</p>
    <p>Freddie knew that naming a male band “Queen” would raise some eyebrows and would be associated with gay terms. Yet he went ahead with this name as he thought it to be a regal, strong and splendid sounding name.</p>
